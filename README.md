# Recession

# Summary

./scripts/* contains the main.py which will visualise data, plot it, and perform statistical analyses and tests

./data/

# Pipeline Map

 - @todo
 
 # Prerequisites and requirements
 
 This entire research pipeline will run automatically to generate plots in the ./data/* directory.
 
 The pipleine will only work (I assume) if the following software is installed, since it was tested on the following:
 
 - Programming language: Python (version 3.2+)
 
 - Programming language add-ons. Python libraries installed via pip as follows:
		   
		All python packages can be installed as such:

		USAGE: sudo pip install *
		 ... of the following:
		    sudo pip install scipy
		    sudo pip install numpy
		    sudo pip install csv
		    sudo pip install pprint
		    sudo pip install copy
		    sudo pip install matplotlib

 
 - Operating System. Any operating system should work, but the pipeline was only tested on Ubuntu (version: Artful Aardvark).

# Notes

@TODO:@ANDY:@2019-08-13: make sure to tell zainab about ssh keys to save hassle, and show her the p-values and plots when they're done

@DEBUGGING:@TODO:@2019-08-13: we get error: "ImportError: No module named _tkinter, please install the python-tk package", so we need to install python-tk via pip, USAGE: "sudo pip install python-tk"
